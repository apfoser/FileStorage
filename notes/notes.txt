1. Efficient traversing of DHT
    - Chord --> "finger tables"
        - m + 2^i
        - O(log(n)) traversal
        - start with O(n) solution and then implement finger tables
        - HashTable[hash(key), hash(ip)]

2. File splitting
    - base implementation done, just need to send && store chunks on base network
    - calculate savings on demo

3. Hardcode nodes
    - maybe macbook? (big if bc it has been wonky)

4. Bugs
    - macbook pro version issues with socket -fixed
    - threading count on exception
    - work on exception handling
